### Svelte
- Allows us to build lightweight modern web applications that use JavaScript but highly optimized JavaScript where you ship as little code as required
- All that code is not just small in size but also very efficient when executed in the browser, hence giving us a very fast application (to load and to run it)
- It is a compiler, not a Framework!
